# cat-crimes-solver
Java class used to solve crime #40 from ThinkFun's "Cat Crimes" game

A large group of family were playing Cat Crimes together (yes, it's fun as a multi-player game too), and we breezed through most of the crimes in all levels, and decided to end our night by skipping to crime #40. After an hour with no solution from ~8 of us, we gave up. 

This only solves number 40. May be interesting to enhance this a bit to see which rules for a given crime are the most effective, which aren't needed, and possibly use this to create new crimes.
